Garfield’s recognizability as a character, or his “Q-Score,” is the same as Big
Bird from Sesame Street, and is higher than Spiderman’s.12 With an overall 95% recognition
score worldwide, it is safe to say that Garfield took the world by storm. The lasagna loving
feline’s popularity makes him a perfect vehicle to discuss other topics, due to the familiarity that
individuals already have with him.

The inclusion of the mundane in
Garfield is both the source of its charm and its tedium

Jon ran for a little over a year before it was
reworked to become Garfield, when Davis realized that the audience was connecting more with
the cat than the man.

He devotes one week a month to write the entire month’s worth of comic strips, churning them out with his hired team of artists. There is
no divine inspiration in the creation of Garfield; the art is made when there is profit to be gained.

A class traitor, Garfield is content to live in his lap of luxury and enjoy
endless food and television entertainment without helping other cats rise to his position.


Owning objects with
Garfield on them allows individuals to take a mass produced item and impart memories and
emotions onto it, through recognition of their connection with reading newspaper comics.


Garfield, at his core, is an apolitical cat. He can behave
this way because he exists in a class that is untouched by the political climate: the leisure class.

wage slaves”, a term that refers to a person whose existence
relies on a paycheck... It shows Garfield saying the antithetical to his famous
“I Hate Mondays” phrase: “Oh, goody. It’s Monday morning; I love Monday mornings.”
Garfield goes on to explain that he loves Monday mornings, “because I don’t have to go to work.” The dream of many hardworking Americans is to one day be able to retire, and do as Garfield does: not have to go to work. The sentiment is individualistic, narcissistic, and
unconscionable, allowing Garfield to only be concerned with his own agenda


Davis is strictly aware of this, and
knows that his comic strip must be universal:
It's a conscious effort to include everyone as readers. If you were to mention the football
strike, you're going to be excluding everyone else in the world that doesn't watch pro
football. Garfield is an international character. Therefore, I don't even use seasons. The
only holiday I recognize is Christmas. I don't use rhyming gags, plays on words,
colloquialisms, in an effort to make Garfield apply to virtually any society where he may
appear. In an effort to keep the gags broad, the humor general and applicable to everyone,
I deal mainly with eating and sleeping. That applies to everyone, anywhere. (Shapiro, W. (1982, December 12). LIVES: “The Cat That Rots the Intellect”. The Washington Post.
Retrieved from https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1982/12/12/lives-the-cat-that-rots-the-
intellect/d6ed28c6-bee3-41ad-81f2-1839b34b87b1/)
To Davis, the
most detrimental thing that Garfield could be is controversial, because controversy does not sell
universally


(calvin and hobbes author) Sacrificing ownership has serious consequences for the artist. For starters, it allows the
syndicate to view the creator as a replaceable part. To most syndicates, the creator of a
popular strip is no more valuable than a hired flunky who can mimic the original. Some
syndicates can replace a cartoonist at will, and most syndicates can replace a cartoonist as
soon as he quits, retires, or dies. This attitude is simply unconscionable, but it's the
standard practice of business.


Here Garfield shows his privilege by being able to ignore the issues in the world. This is
a place of comfort that is celebrated by the capitalistic system: the ability to buy one’s way out of
suffering. On this day in 2012, at least ten civilians were killed by Syrian Forces, and an
earthquake killed 306 in Iran. Garfield’s statement would appeal to an age group who desires the
“quiet” life, an expression used by those typically over the age of 60.


Selling one’s
work does not intrinsically cheapen it, but by making the purpose of it to be bought rather than
communicate a societal truth, it becomes commercial in some instances. Being commodifiable is
one of the key factors to becoming a wealthy creator and artist, and within a capitalistic
democracy, being wealthy is synonymous with being successful


In 1940, the Disney Corporation released
Fantasia, a series of short animated films set to music taken from the public domain in order to
avoid paying licensing fees.143 After the release of the film, some of these previously public
domain works became copyright protected by the Disney Company because of their use in
Fantasia.144 Like Robin Hood on opposite day, Disney stole from the poor to give to the rich.
